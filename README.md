## Note this is just for my own personal practice.
### This is just my own repository to practice some programming questions, and is not reflective of production-ready code.

# TODO:

## Specific implementations to implement and test:
### - LRU Cache
### - Suffix Tree

## Other Interview Questions
### - TBD

## Puzzles
### - Sudoku recursive solver with backtracking.

## Misc:
### - Refactor out dependencies to be installed by pip.
### - Use a test runner to run all unit tests.
### - Add better documentation, especially runtimes and tradeoffs for certain algorithms and data structures.
